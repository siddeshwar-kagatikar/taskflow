Data-driven insights and personalized features empower informed decision-making and cater to individual team needs. Revolutionize your workflows with this all-in-one solution for enhanced work management.

## Implementation:
The frontend is built using React and CSS, while the backend is built using Node, Express, and MongoDB Atlas. I used the entire MERN Stack, even though I didn't have much knowledge when I started the project. <br/>

I had very little to no knowledge about web-devolpment and how websites worked. I started by learning HTML and CSS from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp). I then learnt JavaScript and built a very basic static website using HTML, CSS and JS while following along with tutorials by [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry). I then learnt React, how to use react hooks, React router, and finsihed the basic UI structure of the site. The react documentation is very well written. I then watched [Traversy media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) on how to use APIs and use fetchAPI call from JS, await, async and integrated them. I also used some React libraries like 'react-beautiful-dnd', 'react-type-animation'. I then came to know about responsive websites and made my website mobile friendly. I have styled everything including animations(except the typing animation, which I tried and realized there is a react library for it) in plain CSS, without using any framework. I then felt the need for a backend so that users can add specific exercises to favourites and access them later. I learned node and building apis using express from [Traversy media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA). I used MongoDB atlas to store user info and slots. I learnt about Json web token to store login state also.

## Experience:
I enjoyed building this site as it was my first completely self-built website from scratch. I faced issue in useEffect as it was not rendering when required. Later i found out the issue and solved it. I also had a tough time in drag and drop but some how managed to pull it off. Overall i learnt a lot of new things and I hope I can improve and make better websites.

## Future scope

* As I ran into problems while hosting the website, I want to solve all those issues and host it and also make it optimized for search engines (Search engine optimiziation SEO) .
* I plan on adding file uploads as imp files can be accessed immediately.
* I also plan on making the UI better as I feel it is not up to the mark.
* I also want to figure out a way to make the website available offine, where users can download exercises.
